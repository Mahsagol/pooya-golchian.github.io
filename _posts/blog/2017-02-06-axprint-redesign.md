## Redesign Axprint and Bring Art and Photo to Code!

I'm redesign [axprint.com](http://axprint.com). Old version of this site hosted on this URL [Old axprint](http://axprint.com:8085).

I've used very useful and modern technology for redesign axprint such as:

* sass - bourbon framwork,
* Grunt,
* FlexBox to grid system and product style mixin.

This redesign is very clean and and consider the following has:

* Golden Ratio, boxes, and all style such as padding, margins, ...,
* ModularScale font and typography,
* Use the appropriate picture page content,
* Use modern design and clean and white spaces.
